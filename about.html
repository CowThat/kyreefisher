        <p>My name is Kyree, and I'm passionate about changing experiences to make them easier, more accessible, and more enjoyable for everyone. My main interest areas are web design, UI/UX, and front-end development, but I also have experience and interest in various parts of graphic design.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a BFA in Graphic Design and a minor in Computer Science. I focused my classload and personal projects on my passions, designing for the web and best usability.</p>
        <p>I currently have an internship at circle S studio in Richmond, VA, where I assist with creating web designs and templates, creating graphics and other designs, presenting work both internally and to clients, and coming up with the best user experience while following companies brands and guidelines.</p>
