<p>
    These are from a series of 6 posters that are based on a playlist I curated over the course of a few weeks. I grouped the songs in the playlist into categories based on tempo, what the song was about, its vibe, etc, and then used the album/ song covers from each of the 6 groups to create collage posters. These were my favorite of the 6 posters. I really enjoyed the process of creating this because I gave myself the parameter of using only album covers and had to figure out how to make everything work within that parameter.
