    <p>During the last sprint, SCKS decided are research plans and goals, and decided to focus on researching housing around Richmond and housing laws, as well as the current housing options available. We gathered local, statewide, and federal laws on housing, and tenants rights when renting. We also created a survey and made posters which we posted around different parts around campus.</p>
</div>

<p>For my research, I was focused on gathering information on apartments on and around campus (the Fan, downtown, Jackson Ward, etc) and compiled that information into a google sheet. For each apartment, I collected information about the average cost of rent for each of their bedroom options from studio to four bed. I also took note of other things that would be a monthly cost, such as whether utilities or wifi were covered in the rent. I looked at important factors for many people when selecting an apartment, such as whether they have AC, in unit laundry machines or a laundry facility, or whether they provide parking (or charge additionally for it). I also took note of amenities each apartment provided, such as pets, secure entry, fitness centers, balconies, natural lighting, space, proximity to campus, and more. When I was unable to find specific information online, I called the apartment management and acted like a potential resident to get answers to my questions. If they didn't answer any of my calls or call back from my voicemails, I also factored that into the quality of the management (if they don't respond at all to potential residents, how are they taking care of their current residents?).</p>

<p>Then, I went through multiple sites to find reviews for each apartment and narrowed them down to only reviews posted in the past few years. I took note of changes in their reviews over the years, whether they improved or worsened, and what problems were consistent. I wrote down common problems people mentioned in their reviews and took extra care to interpret the quality of the management, the expediency and quality of maintenance and repairs, and the presence of problems of health and safety such as leaks and pests. </p>


<p>For the next sprint, our team is focusing on other forms of research, especially interviewing. We are going to go to the compass for a few hours and offer candy for people to answer a few interview questions or take our survey. Hopefully, we'll be able to gather information on how people feel about their housing, whether it be positive, negative, or neutral, and get a deeper understanding of different housing options around VCU and how their residents actually feel. We are also going to get as many people to take our survey as possible, and go around hanging up posters with the QR code. Hopefully we will also get an idea of the priorities of residents when searching for homes, and what they are and aren't knowledgable on.</p>

<p>This sprint, I gained a lot of insight on housing options around campus and the common problems they have, as well as the quality and consistency of different property management companies. There are a lot of housing options that manipulate their image to be better than it actually is, but there are also a lot of options that are hidden gems. I learned more about the pricing and amenities that are common, but not much about how people actually feel about these places, so I hope to learn more about that.</p>

<p>This was also a reminder for me of how much I love research and can get completely intrenched in doing research. I found that I loved compiling this and finding the best way to organize it, and look forward to seeing further applications of it in our group work.</p>
