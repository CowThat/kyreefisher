    <p>
        Based on the style of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) books, this booklet was made for my personal D&D campaign.
        <br>
        My main goal for this booklet was to create a comprehensive and stylistically consistent booklet that anyone could use to run a campaign (a D&D game) in this world. I also wanted to give it that worn and torn feeling often associated with older medieval D&D campaign settings. I created all of the layout, as well as all of the images and copy.
