    <p>
        This was a semester long project for my software development class that followed the steps of software development from beginning to end.
    </p>

<div class="project_section">
    <h4>
        <div class="dash-{{ page.color }}-mini"></div>
        requirements
    </h4>

    <p>
        For the project, we had to figure out all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the program. We also figured out the process we would use in development.

<div class="project_section">
    <h4>
        <div class="dash-{{ page.color }}-mini"></div>
        prototypes
    </h4>

    <p>
        These high-fidelity wireframes were made very quickly for the project. Since the project was focused on software development instead of just design, I didn't put as much focus into making sure everything was perfect. Still, I created a quick brand and created mockups of what every page we needed would look like.

<div class="project_section">
    <h4>
        <div class="dash-{{ page.color }}-mini"></div>
        testing the code
    </h4>

    <p>
        Then, we figured out where our code would need to be tested and created the test cases. This was a <i>long</i> document that outlined every possible feature in the program that needed testing and how we would test it.
    </p>

<div class="project_section" >
    <h4>
        <div class="dash-{{ page.color }}-mini"></div>
        user flow
    </h4>

    <p>
        We had to sort out how the user would move through the project, and what parts they would interact with. This was also a very long document
