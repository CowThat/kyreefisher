<div class="project-text">
    <p>For my research, I was focused on gathering information on apartments on and around campus (the Fan, downtown, Jackson Ward, etc) and compiled that information into a google sheet. For each apartment, I collected information about the average cost of rent for each of their bedroom options from studio to four bed. I also took note of other things that would be a monthly cost, such as whether utilities or wifi were covered in the rent. I looked at important factors for many people when selecting an apartment, such as whether they have AC, in unit laundry machines or a laundry facility, or whether they provide parking (or charge additionally for it). I also took note of amenities each apartment provided, such as pets, secure entry, fitness centers, balconies, natural lighting, space, proximity to campus, and more. When I was unable to find specific information online, I called the apartment management and acted like a potential resident to get answers to my questions. If they didn't answer any of my calls or call back from my voicemails, I also factored that into the quality of the management (if they don't respond at all to potential residents, how are they taking care of their current residents?).</p>
