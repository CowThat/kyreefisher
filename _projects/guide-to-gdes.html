    <p>
        For this project, I had to create a front and back pamphlet that was a guide to the GDES program at VCU. I really took this assignment head on given that it was all about mapping, diagramming, and sorting information, and the way that things flow is just as important as how they look. I spent the bulk of my time working on the graph with arrows pointing to different sections. I wanted to create a graph that was complex, but if you took the time to look at it and break it down, you could spend a while looking at all the connections and information on it. So, I spent weeks doing research, then grouping, organizing, and reorganizing the information, creating connections and iterations until I ended with this. Below, you can see the final product, mockups, and pictures of the progress.
