    <p>
        This project was a very long one that included weeks of research, the creation of our pamphlets, having them printed professionally, and then a final exhibition. The focus of this pamphlet was billionaires and the ever increasing wealth gap in America, and I wanted to focus on different ways to present the information instead of just through words, so I focused on creating different graphs, charts, etc.
        I included this print version so that you can see how it folds – in half hamburger style, then in thirds. The folded version is 11.375” x 5” with the top left corner as the cover.
