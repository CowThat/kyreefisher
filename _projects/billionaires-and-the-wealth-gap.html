<p>This project was a very long one that included weeks of research, the creation of our pamphlets, having them printed professionally, and then a final exhibition. The focus of this pamphlet was billionaires and the ever increasing wealth gap in America, and I wanted to focus on different ways to present the information instead of just through words, so I focused on creating different graphs, charts, etc.</p>
