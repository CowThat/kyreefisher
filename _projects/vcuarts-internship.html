    <!-- <p>
        The first image here was made as a mailing for donations for scholarships in VCUarts. This was one of the most successful donation mailings in VCUarts, pulling in thousands in donations.
        
        The second image was made as a poster which was displayed at VCUarts events.
        
        The last two images were made as drafts for an invitation and an email header for a fashion â‰ˆbroadcasting event for VCUarts.
