        about this internship
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have been the intern for the VCUarts development office for the past 3 years. In this internship, my role has shifted to be solely a design, where I tackle any sort of designs that the VCUarts Dean Suite needs. This means that over the past few years, I have created pamphlets, fliers, posters, postcards, and many other types of designs. I have also helped the VCUarts web developer with maintaining and updating the VCUarts website through wordpress. Through all the work that I have done, I have also made sure to keep within the VCUarts brand and style.

        These are some iterations of a donation appeal letter that was mailed to VCUarts alumni and donors for scholarships. It was the most successful donation mailing for VCUarts, pulling in thousands in donations.

        These postcards were mailed out to VCUarts alumni to collect donations for the Annual Fund, a fund that helps gather money for scholarships and other things needed by different VCUarts departments.

    <p>
        As people returned from covid isolation and began attending VCUarts events again, I made this poster, which was printed on a large billboard, for events.
