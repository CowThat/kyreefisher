    <p>
        This website was made for me to practice applying my coding to a full site in my Web Design class. It is fully hand coded and includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, including interactive tables and other types of JS and responsive css. There are still many changes I plan to make to it, and it's being updated as I learn new skills.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        Other coding projects I've made as I learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Java, and Python can be viewed on this website. Everything is always a work in progress as I learn and improve.
